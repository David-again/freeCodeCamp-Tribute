# freeCodeCamp Tribute Project
## A webpage designed for a freeCodeCamp challenge.

You can find details of the challenge [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-tribute-page) (as well as user stories).

You can find a prototype [here](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/zNqgVx).

Update as at 11Dec2020: Finished in one go! See it on my CodePen [here](https://codepen.io/david-again/pen/KKgNYeE)... all 10 of 10 tests passed.

Nothing exciting here... Check out my other works! ðŸ˜Ž
